# Project-627
This is our GitHub page for our 627 Final Project

Within it, you may find the data set titled Nutrition.csv which contained data from the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Our project group used this data to answer six total questions. 

Each group member answered one regression question and one classification question each. The code for Questions 1 and 4 can be found in Model1_Model4.qmd. The code for Questions 2 and 5 can be found in Questions_2_and_5_Models.qmd. The code for Question 3 can be found in Model3.R, and the code for Question 6 can be found in Model6.R.
